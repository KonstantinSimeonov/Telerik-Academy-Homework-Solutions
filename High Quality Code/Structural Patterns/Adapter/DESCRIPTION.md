#Adapter Pattern

+ Intuitive definition: converts an interface to another one
+ Scenario of use: when a system needs to use another system, but their interfaces are incompatible
+ Benefits:
	- helps when dealing with old/legacy systems
	- good when a system needs only a part of the functionality of another system
	- helps dealing with poorly designed components/3d party code
	- gives flexibility for extending the existing code
+ Cons:
	- any suggestions? :D
